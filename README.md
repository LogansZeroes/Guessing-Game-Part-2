# Guessing-Game-Part-1
First part of the Guessing Game project.

Using only HTML and CSS, try to make the project look pretty.

Include 2-4 buttons, 1 input field, and a unique design.

# Guessing-Game-Part-2
Fixed up CSS and HTML to make it look not horribly gaudy.

JS file added using jQuery for the game to function as expected.

New update now has 2 CSS files- bootstrap and a custom one.

Images added for background and success overlay. Taken from Wikimedia Commons.
